------

Source code of [sendtest.email](https://sendtest.email) - a simple tool for sending HTML email tests to your inbox.

[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/3e40d277-84a6-42aa-86a7-724a3fbbef1e/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/send-test-email/deploys)

## Getting Started

### Clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/cossssmin/sendtest.email.git
```

### Install dependencies:

```sh
# Navigate to project directory
cd sendtest.email

# Install dependencies with NPM
npm install
```

### SparkPost API keys

> This is required for local development

Create a `.env.local` file in the project's root, for your SparkPost and reCAPTCHA keys:

```
SPARKPOST_API_KEY=
SPARKPOST_METRICS_KEY=
RECAPTCHA_SECRET=
```

In SparkPost Settings, when generating your keys, you only need the following permissions:

- `SPARKPOST_API_KEY` : Transmissions (both Read-only and Read/Write)
- `SPARKPOST_METRICS_KEY` : Metrics: Read-only

#### Netlify Environment

When using Netlify, make sure to add these environment variables in your admin, under *Build & Deploy &rarr; Continuous Deployment &rarr; Environment*.

### Development

As with any Vue CLI app, `npm run serve` will start a development server.

In our case, it will also start a server for testing Netlify Lambda functions locally, using [`vue-cli-plugin-netlify-lambda`](https://github.com/netlify/vue-cli-plugin-netlify-lambda).
